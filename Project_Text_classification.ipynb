HISTORY OF OVARIAN CYST RESECTION , 1975 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient is a 49 year old woman with a metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast who is status post high dose chemotherapy with PBSE and CCSS support ending June 1994 .\\nShe was admitted on 1-5-94 for fever , chest wall ulceration , cellulitis and pain control .\\nThe patient first presented in October 1991 with a tender right axillary mass .\\nA mammogram done in November 1990 was negative .\\nHowever , mammography repeated in October 1991 showed bilateral breast masses , suspicious for carcinoma .\\nFine needle aspiration on October 23 , 1991 demonstrated atypical cells which occurred singly and in clusters .\\nStaging evaluation included normal liver function tests , normal blood counts and normal chest x-ray .\\nBone scan showed degenerative joint disease in the shoulders and lumbar spine as well as increased radio chaser uptake in the breast bilaterally .\\nDr. Berca Gachfrum performed a right modified mastectomy and left simple mastectomy on November 4 , 1991 .\\nThe right modified radical mastectomy contained a 5.5 cm poorly differentiated , Grade III out of III infiltrating ductal carcinoma .\\nThe margins were free of tumor , but 10 out of 21 lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma .\\nFurthermore there was a mass on the right pectoralis muscle which is supposed to be metastatic cancer .\\nThe left simple mastectomy also contained 5.5 cm poorly differentiated infiltrating ductal and intraductal carcinoma with extensive lymphatic vessel invasion .\\nEstrogen receptor was 0% by ERICA .\\nThe patient developed a large hematoma requiring surgical drainage .\\nTherefore she had a Stage III-A adenocarcinoma of the breast .\\nSince she was at high risk for both local and metastatic recurrence of her tumor , she received both systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy .\\nThe patient was treated with CMSAP , which is Cytoxan , Methotrexate , Leukovoranrescue , 5-FU , Adriamycin and Prednisone for four cycles .\\nThere were no dose reductions for mucositis or myelosuppression .\\nHowever , following cycle 4 , she developed a flu-like illness , followed by fever , nonproductive cough and dyspnea on exertion .\\nABGs showed a pO2 of 79 , pH 7.44 , pO2 33 .\\nChest x-ray showed diffuse interstitial infiltrates .\\nThe differential diagnosis included viral pneumonitis , Mycoplasma , Chlamydia .\\nBasically in December 1993 , she returned to the Hem / Onc Clinic with chest wall nodules which turned out to be tumor recurrences and biopsied .\\nAlthough she had mediastinal recurrence , bone scan , head and liver CT were negative for metastatic disease .\\nShe was thus started on a Protocol of high dose chemotherapy with GCSF and peripheral stem cell support .\\nComplications has mainly included myelosuppression and mucositis .\\nShe also developed Klebsiella UTI after the second cycle of high dose chemotherapy .\\nIt was treated with gent and Cipro .\\nRe-staging done in April 1993 showed a decrease in the pretracheal nodes with question of some lymphangitic spread versus some pneumonitis .\\nIn May 1994 she received her first course of thiotepa and Velban and Methotrexate , which required some red cell transfusions .\\nIn mid May she was admitted for fever and neutropenia and at that time had a UTI with blood clots in the urine .\\nThe patient presents today with complaints of fever and a temperature of 100 .\\nShe has also been having diarrhea since November and her other complaints of admission include confusion , nausea and vomiting .\\nWe will include a very thorough HPI with this dictation that was done by Dr. Wedleung .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nSignificant for metastatic breast cancer , complicated by fever and neutropenia .\\nUTIs , obstruction of the right subclavian vein and right brachial cephalic vein , herpes zoster .\\nStatus post ovarian cyst resection in 1975 .\\nShe had menarche at age 15 .\\nShe used the pill for five years in the past .\\nShe is G 2 , P 2 with spontaneous vaginal deliveries .\\nShe has a history of easy bruis ability .\\nShe is allergic to Augmentin which gives her a rash .\\nMEDICATIONS :\\nMS Contin , MSIR , and Percocet .\\nFAMILY HISTORY :\\nNoncontributory .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nMarried with two children .\\nShe worked as an occupational therapist at a professional center for handicapped children .\\nShe denies tobacco and drug use and drinks ethanol socially .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nA cachectic white female .\\nT 100.1 , P 104 , blood pressure 130/90 , heart rate of 16 , she was sating 95% on room air .\\nHEENT - Pupils were miotic , measuring 2 mm but responsive to light .\\nNeck - Tender on the leftside with no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly .\\nLungs were clear .\\nChest actually had a 5 x 7 cm necrotic area on the left chest wall with some pus .\\nCardiovascular - Normal .\\nAbdomen - Normal .\\nThere was no HSM .\\nExtremities - Her left arm was very swollen .\\nIt was tested with no voluntary movement except at the finger tips .\\nThere was no edema elsewhere in her extremities , only the left arm .\\nNeuro - The patient was oriented to place , but had difficulty with recent memory .\\nShe also had mild weakness in the left extremities , both upper and lower .\\nCranial nerves II - XII were grossly intact .\\nToes were downgoing .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nOf note - Na 133 , K 4 , WBC 8.82 , hematocrit 35.1 , platelets 229 .\\nPT 13.8 with an INR of 1.3 , PTT 25.5 , total protein was 6.2 , albumin 3.4 , globulin of 2.8 , calcium of 9.1 , phos 2.7 , mag 2.1 , urea 3.7 .\\nALT was elevated at 240 , AST 85 , LDH 305 , alk phos 85 , total bilirubin was 1.3 , direct bili was .8 .\\nCholesterol 188 , triglyceride was 127 .\\nUA - trace protein , trace ketones , positive for bilirubin and nitrogen and also 4 to 6 wbcs with 1+ bacteria .\\nChest x-ray - Showed a left paratracheal adenopathy and small left pleural effusion with no evidence of pneumonia .\\nIn summary , the patient is a 49 year old woman with metastatic breast cell CA , status post chemotherapy with CMSAP and PVSC and XRT who presented with fever , four days of diarrhea , nausea and vomiting and had been on Keflex for an erythema on her left chest wall .\\nThe Keflex was stopped when she developed the diarrhea .\\nWhen she arrived the plan was to go ahead and treat here rythematous induration and possible cellulitis with IV antibiotics .\\nSo she was put on dicloxicillin and we did local wound care with an agent called Santyl , which is a collagenace ondebrided which worked very well for her .\\nAlso at the time of admission we were also considering palliative Taxol chemotherapy , which the patient declined .\\nShe refused the Taxol therapy so that was not done .\\nAnother major issue with this patient was pain control .\\nShe had been in a whole lot of pain from her left arm lesion .\\nSo pain control was a big issue so she was on MS Contin and MSIR at home she thought that clouded her thinking , so we tried different things for pain management .\\nOne of them was to do a subarachnoid neurologic block at C6-C7 interface on 1-6-94 .\\nAfter that the patient had minimal relief of pain .\\nHowever , she declined further blocks , which were offered to her .\\nSo accepted to be on dilaudid p.o. which was started at a dosage of 2-4 meg but since then we have tapered it up .\\nShe is now getting dilaudid 8 mg q2h and in addition she has been on fentanyl patch .\\nShe is now getting 75 micrograms per hour of the fentanyl patch which is changed every 72 hours .\\nWe can go up by 25 mg on the fentanyl patch as needed to control her pain and we can always go up on the dilaudid because she is still in considerable amount of pain .\\nOther things that happened during this admission - we obtained ahead CT for her on the 8th of January because of her clouded thinking and altered mental status , which was probably due to the morphine that she was taking .\\nWe went ahead and got a head CT scanand it showed no enhancing lesions .\\nIn addition her liver transaminases were elevated , we thought about doing further work-up , but that was deferred because the patient wanted to wait on that .\\nThat has been stable .\\nThe patient on January 13 became hyponatremic .\\nHer sodium went down to 121 and before that on admission she was 133 .\\nA renal consult was obtained and their assessment was that this was probably a mixture of hypovolemia as well as SIADH .\\nWe proceeded to do for her hyponatremia - we gave her some fluid and her urine sodium became higher than her serum sodium ; we stopped it .\\nWe had given her some normal saline and then we proceeded to just do fluid restriction .\\nIn addition we gave her a sodium chloride one gram per day and that also helped , so that now at the time of discharge , the patient 's sodium is between 126 and 129 ; prior to that it had gone down to as low 116.\\nSo that has really improved .\\nWe suggest continuing increased salt intake in her diet and also continuing with the fluid restriction of free water intake to one liter per day .\\nOn the 14th of January , the patient developed increased shortness of breath and chest x-ray was taken showed a wedge shaped infiltrate in the right upper lobe which was consistent with Hampton 's hump .\\nAlso a VQ scan obtained the next day showed high probability for PE .\\nSo we proceeded to put her on heparin for anticoagulation and then when she was therapeutic on heparin , we went ahead and started her on coumadin and she is currently on coumadin at 2.5 mg q.h.s.\\nHer INR is 2.3 .\\nWe want her INR to remain between 2 and 3 .\\nSo if it goes much lower than 2 , then we would consider increasing it to perhaps coumadin 2.5 and 5 alternating every other night .\\nHowever , we would leave it at 2.5 for now .\\nOther major issues - As a result of all the things happened and with her hyponatremia and also the other problems , her blood pressure was elevated also .\\nWe put her on nifedipine IR , SL and that was not enough to control her blood pressure which was in the 200s in the systolic , so we had started her on atenolol .\\nSo on discharge she is on atenolol 100 .\\nIf needed to you can give her some nifedipine SL to decrease her blood pressure .\\nThe patient also has significant edema in both arms now and also some mild edema in the lower extremities , so I think that fluid restriction should help with that .\\nShe is also a little dry .\\nThe patient is on oxygen .\\nEver since the pulmonary embolus she has been on oxygen .\\nShe was on 4 liters ; now she is on 5 liters , sating 94 to 96% on 5 liters .\\nWe would like for her to remain on the oxygen as well .\\nThe complications that I have listed include the hyponatremia , pulmonary embolus and also the elevatd blood pressure .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nDischarge medications - Baclofen 10 p.o. t.i.d. , MVI one tablet p.o. q.d. , Mycostatin powder TP q.d. to be applied to the rash in her left groin area , also dilaudid 8 mg p.o. q2h , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. fentanyl patch 75 micrograms per hour topical q72 hours , atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.d.\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nFair .\\nShe remains very weak and will most likely benefit from some physical therapy andshe still has the bilateral edema .\\nShe is to go to the Necsoncardel Medical Center for more chronic care .\\nFollow-up is with Dr. Wedleung in the Hem / Onc in two weeks .\\nThe appointment has already been made .\\nThe patient is very limited in how much she can do right now because of her pain primarily and her difficulty breathing .\\nDictated By :\\nJEABRIHARL FIGEFREIERMFOTHGRENDCAJAQUE , M.D.\\nAttending :\\nLA INEMACISTIN PRONTMANDES , M.D. HD45 SY882/1177\\nBatch :\\n020\\nIndex No.\\nYJQI3J9VU6\\nD :\\n01/25/94\\nT :\\n01/25/94\\n[ report_end ]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

HISTORY OF OVARIAN CYST RESECTION , 1975 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient is a 49 year old woman with a metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast who is status post high dose chemotherapy with PBSE and CCSS support ending June 1994 .\\nShe was admitted on 1-5-94 for fever , chest wall ulceration , cellulitis and pain control .\\nThe patient first presented in October 1991 with a tender right axillary mass .\\nA mammogram done in November 1990 was negative .\\nHowever , mammography repeated in October 1991 showed bilateral breast masses , suspicious for carcinoma .\\nFine needle aspiration on October 23 , 1991 demonstrated atypical cells which occurred singly and in clusters .\\nStaging evaluation included normal liver function tests , normal blood counts and normal chest x-ray .\\nBone scan showed degenerative joint disease in the shoulders and lumbar spine as well as increased radio chaser uptake in the breast bilaterally .\\nDr. Berca Gachfrum performed a right modified mastectomy and left simple mastectomy on November 4 , 1991 .\\nThe right modified radical mastectomy contained a 5.5 cm poorly differentiated , Grade III out of III infiltrating ductal carcinoma .\\nThe margins were free of tumor , but 10 out of 21 lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma .\\nFurthermore there was a mass on the right pectoralis muscle which is supposed to be metastatic cancer .\\nThe left simple mastectomy also contained 5.5 cm poorly differentiated infiltrating ductal and intraductal carcinoma with extensive lymphatic vessel invasion .\\nEstrogen receptor was 0% by ERICA .\\nThe patient developed a large hematoma requiring surgical drainage .\\nTherefore she had a Stage III-A adenocarcinoma of the breast .\\nSince she was at high risk for both local and metastatic recurrence of her tumor , she received both systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy .\\nThe patient was treated with CMSAP , which is Cytoxan , Methotrexate , Leukovoranrescue , 5-FU , Adriamycin and Prednisone for four cycles .\\nThere were no dose reductions for mucositis or myelosuppression .\\nHowever , following cycle 4 , she developed a flu-like illness , followed by fever , nonproductive cough and dyspnea on exertion .\\nABGs showed a pO2 of 79 , pH 7.44 , pO2 33 .\\nChest x-ray showed diffuse interstitial infiltrates .\\nThe differential diagnosis included viral pneumonitis , Mycoplasma , Chlamydia .\\nBasically in December 1993 , she returned to the Hem / Onc Clinic with chest wall nodules which turned out to be tumor recurrences and biopsied .\\nAlthough she had mediastinal recurrence , bone scan , head and liver CT were negative for metastatic disease .\\nShe was thus started on a Protocol of high dose chemotherapy with GCSF and peripheral stem cell support .\\nComplications has mainly included myelosuppression and mucositis .\\nShe also developed Klebsiella UTI after the second cycle of high dose chemotherapy .\\nIt was treated with gent and Cipro .\\nRe-staging done in April 1993 showed a decrease in the pretracheal nodes with question of some lymphangitic spread versus some pneumonitis .\\nIn May 1994 she received her first course of thiotepa and Velban and Methotrexate , which required some red cell transfusions .\\nIn mid May she was admitted for fever and neutropenia and at that time had a UTI with blood clots in the urine .\\nThe patient presents today with complaints of fever and a temperature of 100 .\\nShe has also been having diarrhea since November and her other complaints of admission include confusion , nausea and vomiting .\\nWe will include a very thorough HPI with this dictation that was done by Dr. Wedleung .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nSignificant for metastatic breast cancer , complicated by fever and neutropenia .\\nUTIs , obstruction of the right subclavian vein and right brachial cephalic vein , herpes zoster .\\nStatus post ovarian cyst resection in 1975 .\\nShe had menarche at age 15 .\\nShe used the pill for five years in the past .\\nShe is G 2 , P 2 with spontaneous vaginal deliveries .\\nShe has a history of easy bruis ability .\\nShe is allergic to Augmentin which gives her a rash .\\nMEDICATIONS :\\nMS Contin , MSIR , and Percocet .\\nFAMILY HISTORY :\\nNoncontributory .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nMarried with two children .\\nShe worked as an occupational therapist at a professional center for handicapped children .\\nShe denies tobacco and drug use and drinks ethanol socially .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nA cachectic white female .\\nT 100.1 , P 104 , blood pressure 130/90 , heart rate of 16 , she was sating 95% on room air .\\nHEENT - Pupils were miotic , measuring 2 mm but responsive to light .\\nNeck - Tender on the leftside with no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly .\\nLungs were clear .\\nChest actually had a 5 x 7 cm necrotic area on the left chest wall with some pus .\\nCardiovascular - Normal .\\nAbdomen - Normal .\\nThere was no HSM

small left pleural effusion with no evidence of pneumonia .\\nIn summary , the patient is a 49 year old woman with metastatic breast cell CA , status post chemotherapy with CMSAP and PVSC and XRT who presented with fever , four days of diarrhea , nausea and vomiting and had been on Keflex for an erythema on her left chest wall .\\nThe Keflex was stopped when she developed the diarrhea .\\nWhen she arrived the plan was to go ahead and treat here rythematous induration and possible cellulitis with IV antibiotics .\\nSo she was put on dicloxicillin and we did local wound care with an agent called Santyl , which is a collagenace ondebrided which worked very well for her .\\nAlso at the time of admission we were also considering palliative Taxol chemotherapy , which the patient declined .\\nShe refused the Taxol therapy so that was not done .\\nAnother major issue with this patient was pain control .\\nShe had been in a whole lot of pain from her left arm lesion .\\nSo pain control was a big issue so she was on MS Contin and MSIR at home she thought that clouded her thinking , so we tried different things for pain management .\\nOne of them was to do a subarachnoid neurologic block at C6-C7 interface on 1-6-94 .\\nAfter that the patient had minimal relief of pain .\\nHowever , she declined further blocks , which were offered to her .\\nSo accepted to be on dilaudid p.o. which was started at a dosage of 2-4 meg but since then we have tapered it up .\\nShe is now getting dilaudid 8 mg q2h and in addition she has been on fentanyl patch .\\nShe is now getting 75 micrograms per hour of the fentanyl patch which is changed every 72 hours .\\nWe can go up by 25 mg on the fentanyl patch as needed to control her pain and we can always go up on the dilaudid because she is still in considerable amount of pain .\\nOther things that happened during this admission - we obtained ahead CT for her on the 8th of January because of her clouded thinking and altered mental status , which was probably due to the morphine that she was taking .\\nWe went ahead and got a head CT scanand it showed no enhancing lesions .\\nIn addition her liver transaminases were elevated , we thought about doing further work-up , but that was deferred because the patient wanted to wait on that .\\nThat has been stable .\\nThe patient on January 13 became hyponatremic .\\nHer sodium went down to 121 and before that on admission she was 133 .\\nA renal consult was obtained and their assessment was that this was probably a mixture of hypovolemia as well as SIADH .\\nWe proceeded to do for her hyponatremia - we gave her some fluid and her urine sodium became higher than her serum sodium ; we stopped it .\\nWe had given her some normal saline and then we proceeded to just do fluid restriction .\\nIn addition we gave her a sodium chloride one gram per day and that also helped , so that now at the time of discharge , the patient 's sodium is between 126 and 129 ; prior to that it had gone down to as low 116.\\nSo that has really improved .\\nWe suggest continuing increased salt intake in her diet and also continuing with the fluid restriction of free water intake to one liter per day .\\nOn the 14th of January , the patient developed increased shortness of breath and chest x-ray was taken showed a wedge shaped infiltrate in the right upper lobe which was consistent with Hampton 's hump .\\nAlso a VQ scan obtained the next day showed high probability for PE .\\nSo we proceeded to put her on heparin for anticoagulation and then when she was therapeutic on heparin , we went ahead and started her on coumadin and she is currently on coumadin at 2.5 mg q.h.s.\\nHer INR is 2.3 .\\nWe want her INR to remain between 2 and 3 .\\nSo if it goes much lower than 2 , then we would consider increasing it to perhaps coumadin 2.5 and 5 alternating every other night .\\nHowever , we would leave it at 2.5 for now .\\nOther major issues - As a result of all the things happened and with her hyponatremia and also the other problems , her blood pressure was elevated also .\\nWe put her on nifedipine IR , SL and that was not enough to control her blood pressure which was in the 200s in the systolic , so we had started her on atenolol .\\nSo on discharge she is on atenolol 100 .\\nIf needed to you can give her some nifedipine SL to decrease her blood pressure .\\nThe patient also has significant edema in both arms now and also some mild edema in the lower extremities , so I think that fluid restriction should help with that .\\nShe is also a little dry .\\nThe patient is on oxygen .\\nEver since the pulmonary embolus she has been on oxygen .\\nShe was on 4 liters ; now she is on 5 liters , sating 94 to 96% on 5 liters .\\nWe would like for her to remain on the oxygen as well .\\nThe complications that I have listed include the hyponatremia , pulmonary embolus and also the elevatd blood pressure .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nDischarge medications - Baclofen 10 p.o. t.i.d. , MVI one tablet p.o. q.d. , Mycostatin powder TP q.d. to be applied to the rash in her left groin area , also dilaudid 8 mg p.o. q2h , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. fentanyl patch 75 micrograms per hour topical q72 hours , atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.d.\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nFair .\\nShe remains very weak and will most likely benefit from some physical therapy andshe still has the bilateral edema .\\nShe is to go to the Necsoncardel Medical Center for more chronic care .\\nFollow-up is with Dr. Wedleung in the Hem / Onc in two weeks .\\nThe appointment has already been made .\\nThe patient is very limited in how much she can do right now because of her pain primarily and her difficulty breathing .\\nDictated By :\\nJEABRIHARL FIGEFREIERMFOTHGRENDCAJAQUE ,

metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast who is status post high dose chemotherapy with pbse and ccss support ending june 1994 .\\nshe was admitted on 1-5-94 for fever , chest wall ulceration , cellulitis and pain control .\\nthe patient first presented in october 1991 with a tender right axillary mass .\\na mammogram done in november 1990 was negative .\\nhowever , mammography repeated in october 1991 showed bilateral breast masses , suspicious for carcinoma .\\nfine needle aspiration on october 23 , 1991 demonstrated atypical cells which occurred singly and in clusters .\\nstaging evaluation included normal liver function tests , normal blood counts and normal chest x-ray .\\nbone scan showed degenerative joint disease in the shoulders and lumbar spine as well as increased radio chaser uptake in the breast bilaterally .\\ndr. berca gachfrum performed a right modified mastectomy and left simple mastectomy on november 4 , 1991 .\\nthe right modified radical mastectomy contained a 5.5 cm poorly differentiated , grade iii out of iii infiltrating ductal carcinoma .\\nthe margins were free of tumor , but 10 out of 21 lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma .\\nfurthermore there was a mass on the right pectoralis muscle which is supposed to be metastatic cancer .\\nthe left simple mastectomy also contained 5.5 cm poorly differentiated infiltrating ductal and intraductal carcinoma with extensive lymphatic vessel invasion .\\nestrogen receptor was 0% by erica .\\nthe patient developed a large hematoma requiring surgical drainage .\\ntherefore she had a stage iii-a adenocarcinoma of the breast .\\nsince she was at high risk for both local and metastatic recurrence of her tumor , she received both systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy .\\nthe patient was treated with cmsap , which is cytoxan , methotrexate , leukovoranrescue , 5-fu , adriamycin and prednisone for four cycles .\\nthere were no dose reductions for mucositis or myelosuppression .\\nhowever , following cycle 4 , she developed a flu-like illness , followed by fever , nonproductive cough and dyspnea on exertion .\\nabgs showed a po2 of 79 , ph 7.44 , po2 33 .\\nchest x-ray showed diffuse interstitial infiltrates .\\nthe differential diagnosis included viral pneumonitis , mycoplasma , chlamydia .\\nbasically in december 1993 , she returned to the hem / onc clinic with chest wall nodules which turned out to be tumor recurrences and biopsied .\\nalthough she had mediastinal recurrence , bone scan , head and liver ct were negative for metastatic disease .\\nshe was thus started on a protocol of high dose chemotherapy with gcsf and peripheral stem cell support .\\ncomplications has mainly included myelosuppression and mucositis .\\nshe also developed klebsiella uti after the second cycle of high dose chemotherapy .\\nit was treated with gent and cipro .\\nre-staging done in april 1993 showed a decrease in the pretracheal nodes with question of some lymphangitic spread versus some pneumonitis .\\nin may 1994 she received her first course of thiotepa and velban and methotrexate , which required some red cell transfusions .\\nin mid may she was admitted for fever and neutropenia and at that time had a uti with blood clots in the urine .\\nthe patient presents today with complaints of fever and a temperature of 100 .\\nshe has also been having diarrhea since november and her other complaints of admission include confusion , nausea and vomiting .\\nwe will include a very thorough hpi with this dictation that was done by dr.

were miotic , measuring 2 mm but responsive to light .\\nneck - tender on the leftside with no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly .\\nlungs were clear .\\nchest actually had a 5 x 7 cm necrotic area on the left chest wall with some pus .\\ncardiovascular - normal .\\nabdomen - normal .\\nthere was no hsm .\\nextremities - her left arm was very swollen .\\nit was tested with no voluntary movement except at the finger tips .\\nthere was no edema elsewhere in her extremities , only the left arm .\\nneuro - the patient was oriented to place , but had difficulty with recent memory .\\nshe also had mild weakness in the left extremities , both upper and lower .\\ncranial nerves ii - xii were grossly intact .\\ntoes were downgoing .\\nlaboratory data :\\nof note - na 133 , k 4 , wbc 8.82 ,

we proceeded to put her on heparin for anticoagulation and then when she was therapeutic on heparin , we went ahead and started her on coumadin and she is currently on coumadin at 2.5 mg q.h.s.\\nher inr is 2.3 .\\nwe want her inr to remain between 2 and 3 .\\nso if it goes much lower than 2 , then we would consider increasing it to perhaps coumadin 2.5 and 5 alternating every other night .\\nhowever , we would leave it at 2.5 for now .\\nother major issues - as a result of all the things happened and with her hyponatremia and also the other problems , her blood pressure was elevated also .\\nwe put her on nifedipine ir , sl and that was not enough to control her blood pressure which was in the 200s in the systolic , so we had started her on atenolol .\\nso on discharge she is on

HISTORY OF OVARIAN CYST RESECTION , 1975 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient is a 49 year old woman with a metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast who is status post high dose chemotherapy with PBSE and CCSS support ending June 1994 .\\nShe was admitted on 1-5-94 for fever , chest wall ulceration , cellulitis and pain control .\\nThe patient first presented in October 1991 with a tender right axillary mass .\\nA mammogram done in November 1990 was negative .\\nHowever , mammography repeated in October 1991 showed bilateral breast masses , suspicious for carcinoma .\\nFine needle aspiration on October 23 , 1991 demonstrated atypical cells which occurred singly and in clusters .\\nStaging evaluation included normal liver function tests , normal blood counts and normal chest x-ray .\\nBone scan showed degenerative joint disease in the shoulders and lumbar spine as well as increased radio chaser uptake in the breast bilaterally .\\nDr. Berca Gachfrum performed a right modified mastectomy and left simple mastectomy on November 4 , 1991 .\\nThe right modified radical mastectomy contained a 5.5 cm poorly differentiated , Grade III out of III infiltrating ductal carcinoma .\\nThe margins were free of tumor , but 10 out of 21 lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma .\\nFurthermore there was a mass on the right pectoralis muscle which is supposed to be metastatic cancer .\\nThe left simple mastectomy also contained 5.5 cm poorly differentiated infiltrating ductal and intraductal carcinoma with extensive lymphatic vessel invasion .\\nEstrogen receptor was 0% by ERICA .\\nThe patient developed a large hematoma requiring surgical drainage .\\nTherefore she had a Stage III-A adenocarcinoma of the breast .\\nSince she was at high risk for both local and metastatic recurrence of her tumor , she received both systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy .\\nThe patient was treated with CMSAP , which is Cytoxan , Methotrexate , Leukovoranrescue , 5-FU , Adriamycin and Prednisone for four cycles .\\nThere were no dose reductions for mucositis or myelosuppression .\\nHowever , following cycle 4 , she developed a flu-like illness , followed by fever , nonproductive cough and dyspnea on exertion .\\nABGs showed a pO2 of 79 , pH 7.44 , pO2 33 .\\nChest x-ray showed diffuse interstitial infiltrates .\\nThe differential diagnosis included viral pneumonitis , Mycoplasma , Chlamydia .\\nBasically in December 1993 , she returned to the Hem / Onc Clinic with chest wall nodules which turned out to be tumor recurrences and biopsied .\\nAlthough she had mediastinal recurrence , bone scan , head and liver CT were negative for metastatic disease .\\nShe was thus started on a Protocol of high dose chemotherapy with GCSF and peripheral stem cell support .\\nComplications has mainly included myelosuppression and mucositis .\\nShe also developed Klebsiella UTI after the second cycle of high dose chemotherapy .\\nIt was treated with gent and Cipro .\\nRe-staging done in April 1993 showed a decrease in the pretracheal nodes with question of some lymphangitic spread versus some pneumonitis .\\nIn May 1994 she received her first course of thiotepa and Velban and Methotrexate , which required some red cell transfusions .\\nIn mid May she was admitted for fever and neutropenia and at that time had a UTI with blood clots in the urine .\\nThe patient presents today with complaints of fever and a temperature of 100 .\\nShe has also been having diarrhea since November and her other complaints of admission include confusion , nausea and vomiting .\\nWe will include a very thorough HPI with this dictation that was done by Dr. Wedleung .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nSignificant for metastatic breast cancer , complicated by fever and neutropenia .\\nUTIs , obstruction of the right subclavian vein and right brachial cephalic vein , herpes zoster .\\nStatus post ovarian cyst resection in 1975 .\\nShe had menarche at age 15 .\\nShe

triglyceride was 127 .\\nUA - trace protein , trace ketones , positive for bilirubin and nitrogen and also 4 to 6 wbcs with 1+ bacteria .\\nChest x-ray - Showed a left paratracheal adenopathy and small left pleural effusion with no evidence of pneumonia .\\nIn summary , the patient is a 49 year old woman with metastatic breast cell CA , status post chemotherapy with CMSAP and PVSC and XRT who presented with fever , four days of diarrhea , nausea and vomiting and had been on Keflex for an erythema on her left chest wall .\\nThe Keflex was stopped when she developed the diarrhea .\\nWhen she arrived the plan was to go ahead and treat here rythematous induration and possible cellulitis with IV antibiotics .\\nSo she was put on dicloxicillin and we did local wound care with an agent called Santyl , which is a collagenace ondebrided which worked very well for her .\\nAlso at the time of admission we were also considering palliative Taxol chemotherapy , which the patient declined .\\nShe refused the Taxol therapy so that was not done .\\nAnother major issue with this patient was pain control .\\nShe had been in a whole lot of pain from her left arm lesion .\\nSo pain control was a big issue so she was on MS Contin and MSIR at home she thought that clouded her thinking , so we tried different things for pain management .\\nOne of them was to do a subarachnoid neurologic block at C6-C7 interface on 1-6-94 .\\nAfter that the patient had minimal relief of pain .\\nHowever , she declined further blocks , which were offered to her .\\nSo accepted to be on dilaudid p.o. which was started at a dosage of 2-4 meg but since then we have tapered it up .\\nShe is now getting dilaudid 8 mg q2h and in addition she has been on fentanyl patch .\\nShe is now getting 75 micrograms per hour of the fentanyl patch which is changed every 72 hours .\\nWe can go up by 25 mg on the fentanyl patch as needed to control her pain and we can always go up on the dilaudid because she is still in considerable amount of pain .\\nOther things that happened during this admission - we obtained ahead CT for her on the 8th of January because of her clouded thinking and altered mental status , which was probably due to the morphine that she was taking .\\nWe went ahead and got a head CT scanand it showed no enhancing lesions .\\nIn addition her liver transaminases were elevated , we thought about doing further work-up , but that was deferred because the patient wanted to wait on that .\\nThat has been stable .\\nThe patient on January 13 became hyponatremic .\\nHer sodium went down to 121 and before that on admission she was 133 .\\nA renal consult was obtained and their assessment was that this was probably a mixture of hypovolemia as well as SIADH .\\nWe proceeded to do for her hyponatremia - we gave her some fluid and her urine sodium became higher than her serum sodium ; we stopped it .\\nWe had given her some normal saline and then we proceeded to just do fluid restriction .\\nIn addition we gave her a sodium chloride one gram per day and that also helped , so that now at the time of discharge , the patient 's sodium is between 126 and 129 ; prior to that it had gone down to as low 116.\\nSo that has really improved .\\nWe suggest continuing increased salt intake in her diet and also continuing with the fluid restriction of free water intake to one liter per day .\\nOn the 14th of January , the patient developed increased shortness of breath and chest x-ray was taken showed a wedge shaped infiltrate in the right upper lobe which was consistent with Hampton 's hump .\\nAlso a VQ scan obtained the next day showed high probability for PE .\\nSo we proceeded to put her on heparin for anticoagulation and then when she was therapeutic on heparin , we went ahead and started her on coumadin and she is currently on coumadin at 2.5 mg q.h.s.\\nHer INR is 2.3 .\\nWe want her INR to remain between 2 and 3 .\\nSo if it goes much lower than 2 , then we would consider increasing it to perhaps coumadin 2.5 and 5 alternating every other night .\\nHowever , we would leave it at 2.5 for now .\\nOther major issues - As a result of all the things happened and with her hyponatremia and also the other problems , her blood pressure was elevated also .\\nWe put her on nifedipine IR , SL and that was not enough to control her blood pressure which was in the 200s in the systolic , so we had started her on atenolol .\\nSo on discharge she is on atenolol 100 .\\nIf needed to you can give her some nifedipine SL to decrease her blood pressure .\\nThe patient also has significant edema in both arms now and also some mild edema in the lower extremities , so I think that fluid restriction should help with that .\\nShe is also a little dry .\\nThe patient is on oxygen .\\nEver since the pulmonary embolus she has been on oxygen .\\nShe was on 4 liters ; now she is on 5 liters , sating 94 to 96% on 5 liters .\\nWe would like for her to remain on the oxygen as well .\\nThe complications that I have listed include the hyponatremia , pulmonary embolus and also the elevatd blood pressure .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nDischarge medications - Baclofen 10 p.o. t.i.d. , MVI one tablet p.o. q.d. , Mycostatin powder TP q.d. to be applied to the rash in her left groin area , also dilaudid 8 mg p.o. q2h , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. fentanyl patch 75 micrograms per hour topical q72 hours , atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.d.\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nFair .\\nShe remains very weak and will most likely benefit from some physical therapy andshe still has the bilateral edema .\\nShe is to go to the Necsoncardel Medical Center for more chronic care .\\nFollow-up is with Dr. Wedleung in the Hem / Onc in two weeks .\\nThe appointment has already been made .\\nThe patient is very limited in how much she can do right now because of her pain primarily and her difficulty breathing .\\nDictated By :\\nJEABRIHARL FIGEFREIERMFOTHGRENDCAJAQUE ,

HISTORY OF OVARIAN CYST RESECTION , 1975 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient is a 49 year old woman with a metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast who is status post high dose chemotherapy with PBSE and CCSS support ending June 1994 .\\nShe was admitted on 1-5-94 for fever , chest wall ulceration , cellulitis and pain control .\\nThe patient first presented in October 1991 with a tender right axillary mass .\\nA mammogram done in November 1990 was negative .\\nHowever , mammography repeated in October 1991 showed bilateral breast masses , suspicious for carcinoma .\\nFine needle aspiration on October 23 , 1991 demonstrated atypical cells which occurred singly and in clusters .\\nStaging evaluation included normal liver function tests , normal blood counts and normal chest x-ray .\\nBone scan showed degenerative joint disease in the shoulders and lumbar spine as well as increased radio chaser uptake in the breast bilaterally .\\nDr. Berca Gachfrum performed a right modified mastectomy and left simple mastectomy on November 4 , 1991 .\\nThe right modified radical mastectomy contained a 5.5 cm poorly differentiated , Grade III out of III infiltrating ductal carcinoma .\\nThe margins were free of tumor , but 10 out of 21 lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma .\\nFurthermore there was a mass on the right pectoralis muscle which is supposed to be metastatic cancer .\\nThe left simple mastectomy also contained 5.5 cm poorly differentiated infiltrating ductal and intraductal carcinoma with extensive lymphatic vessel invasion .\\nEstrogen receptor was 0% by ERICA .\\nThe patient developed a large hematoma requiring surgical drainage .\\nTherefore she had a Stage III-A adenocarcinoma of the breast .\\nSince she was at high risk for both local and metastatic recurrence of her tumor , she received both systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy .\\nThe patient was treated with CMSAP , which is Cytoxan , Methotrexate , Leukovoranrescue , 5-FU , Adriamycin and Prednisone for four cycles .\\nThere were no dose reductions for mucositis or myelosuppression .\\nHowever , following cycle 4 , she developed a flu-like illness , followed by fever , nonproductive cough and dyspnea on exertion .\\nABGs showed a pO2 of 79 , pH 7.44 , pO2 33 .\\nChest x-ray showed diffuse interstitial infiltrates .\\nThe differential diagnosis included viral pneumonitis , Mycoplasma , Chlamydia .\\nBasically in December 1993 , she returned to the Hem / Onc Clinic with chest wall nodules which turned out to be tumor recurrences and biopsied .\\nAlthough she had mediastinal recurrence , bone scan , head and liver CT were negative for metastatic disease .\\nShe was thus started on a Protocol of high dose chemotherapy with GCSF and peripheral stem cell support .\\nComplications has mainly included myelosuppression and mucositis .\\nShe also developed Klebsiella UTI after the second cycle of high dose chemotherapy .\\nIt was treated with gent and Cipro .\\nRe-staging done in April 1993 showed a decrease in the pretracheal nodes with question of some lymphangitic spread versus some pneumonitis .\\nIn May 1994 she received her first course of thiotepa and Velban and Methotrexate , which required some red cell transfusions .\\nIn mid May she was admitted for fever and neutropenia and at that time had a UTI with blood clots in the urine .\\nThe patient presents today with complaints of fever and a temperature of 100 .\\nShe has also been having diarrhea since November and her other complaints of admission include confusion , nausea and vomiting .\\nWe will include a very thorough HPI with this dictation that was done by Dr. Wedleung .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nSignificant for metastatic breast cancer , complicated by fever and neutropenia .\\nUTIs , obstruction of the right subclavian vein and right brachial cephalic vein , herpes zoster .\\nStatus post ovarian cyst resection in 1975 .\\nShe had menarche at age 15 .\\nShe used the pill for five years in the past .\\nShe is G 2 , P 2 with spontaneous vaginal deliveries .\\nShe has a history of easy bruis ability .\\nShe is allergic to Augmentin which gives her a rash .\\nMEDICATIONS :\\nMS Contin , MSIR , and Percocet .\\nFAMILY HISTORY :\\nNoncontributory .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nMarried with two children .\\nShe worked as an occupational therapist at a professional center for handicapped children .\\nShe denies tobacco and drug use and drinks ethanol socially .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nA cachectic white female .\\nT 100.1 , P 104 , blood pressure 130/90 , heart rate of 16 , she was sating 95% on room air .\\nHEENT - Pupils were miotic , measuring 2 mm but responsive to light .\\nNeck - Tender on the leftside with no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly .\\nLungs were clear .\\nChest actually had a 5 x 7 cm necrotic area on the left chest wall with some pus .\\nCardiovascular - Normal .\\nAbdomen - Normal .\\nThere was no HSM .\\nExtremities - Her left arm was very swollen .\\nIt was tested with no voluntary movement except at the finger tips .\\nThere was no edema elsewhere in her extremities , only the left arm .\\nNeuro - The patient was oriented to place , but had difficulty with recent memory .\\nShe also had mild weakness in the left extremities , both upper and lower .\\nCranial nerves II - XII were grossly intact .\\nToes were downgoing .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nOf note - Na 133 , K 4 , WBC 8.82 , hematocrit 35.1 , platelets 229 .\\nPT 13.8 with an INR of 1.3 , PTT 25.5 , total protein was 6.2 , albumin 3.4 , globulin of 2.8 , calcium of 9.1 , phos 2.7 , mag 2.1 , urea 3.7 .\\nALT was elevated at 240 , AST 85 , LDH 305 , alk phos 85 , total bilirubin was 1.3 , direct bili was .8 .\\nCholesterol 188 , triglyceride was 127 .\\nUA - trace protein , trace ketones , positive for bilirubin and nitrogen and also 4 to 6 wbcs with 1+ bacteria .\\nChest x-ray - Showed a left paratracheal adenopathy and small left pleural effusion with no evidence of pneumonia .\\nIn summary , the patient is a 49 year old woman with metastatic breast cell CA , status post chemotherapy with CMSAP and PVSC and XRT who presented with fever , four days of diarrhea , nausea and vomiting and had been on Keflex for an erythema on her left chest wall .\\nThe Keflex was stopped when she developed the diarrhea .\\nWhen she arrived the plan was to go ahead and treat here rythematous induration and possible cellulitis with IV antibiotics .\\nSo she was put on dicloxicillin and we did local wound care with an agent called Santyl , which is a collagenace ondebrided which worked very well for her .\\nAlso at the time of admission we were also considering palliative Taxol chemotherapy , which the patient declined .\\nShe refused the Taxol therapy so that was not done .\\nAnother major issue with this patient was pain control .\\nShe had been in a whole lot of pain from her left arm lesion .\\nSo pain control was a big issue so she was on MS Contin and MSIR at home she thought that clouded her thinking , so we tried different things for pain management .\\nOne of them was to do a subarachnoid neurologic block at C6-C7 interface on 1-6-94 .\\nAfter that the patient had minimal relief of pain .\\nHowever , she declined further blocks , which were offered to her .\\nSo accepted to be on dilaudid p.o. which was started at a dosage of 2-4 meg but since then we have tapered it up .\\nShe is now getting dilaudid 8 mg q2h and in addition she has been on fentanyl patch .\\nShe is now getting 75 micrograms per hour of the fentanyl patch which is changed every 72 hours .\\nWe can go up by 25 mg on the fentanyl patch as needed to control her pain and we can always go up on the dilaudid because she is still in considerable amount of pain .\\nOther things that happened during this admission - we obtained ahead CT for her on the 8th of January because of her clouded thinking and altered mental status , which was probably due to the morphine that she was taking .\\nWe went ahead and got a head CT scanand it showed no enhancing lesions .\\nIn addition her liver transaminases were elevated , we thought about doing further work-up , but that was deferred because the patient wanted to wait on that .\\nThat has been stable .\\nThe patient on January 13 became hyponatremic .\\nHer sodium went down to 121 and before that on admission she was 133 .\\nA renal consult was obtained and their assessment was that this was probably a mixture of hypovolemia as well as SIADH .\\nWe proceeded to do for her hyponatremia - we gave her some fluid and her urine sodium became higher than her serum sodium ; we stopped it .\\nWe had given her some normal saline and then we proceeded to just do fluid restriction .\\nIn addition we gave her a sodium chloride one gram per day and that also helped , so that now at the time of discharge , the patient 's sodium is between 126 and 129 ; prior to that it had gone down to as low 116.\\nSo that has really improved .\\nWe suggest continuing increased salt intake in her diet and also continuing with the fluid restriction of free water intake to one liter per day .\\nOn the 14th of January , the patient developed increased shortness of breath and chest x-ray was taken showed a wedge shaped infiltrate in the right upper lobe which was consistent with Hampton 's hump .\\nAlso a VQ scan obtained the next day showed high probability for PE .\\nSo we proceeded to put her on heparin for anticoagulation and then when she was therapeutic on heparin , we went ahead and started her on coumadin and she is currently on coumadin at 2.5 mg q.h.s.\\nHer INR is 2.3 .\\nWe want her INR to remain between 2 and 3 .\\nSo if it goes much lower than 2 , then we would consider increasing it to perhaps coumadin 2.5 and 5 alternating every other night .\\nHowever , we would leave it at 2.5 for now .\\nOther major issues - As a result of all the things happened and with her hyponatremia and also the other problems , her blood pressure was elevated also .\\nWe put her on nifedipine IR , SL and that was not enough to control her blood pressure which was in the 200s in the systolic , so we had started her on atenolol .\\nSo on discharge she is on atenolol 100 .\\nIf needed to you can give her some nifedipine SL to decrease her blood pressure .\\nThe patient also has significant edema in both arms now and also some mild edema in the lower extremities , so I think that fluid restriction should help with that .\\nShe is also a little dry .\\nThe patient is on oxygen .\\nEver since the pulmonary embolus she has been on oxygen .\\nShe was on 4 liters ; now she is on 5 liters , sating 94 to 96% on 5 liters .\\nWe would like for her to remain on the oxygen as well .\\nThe complications that I have listed include the hyponatremia , pulmonary embolus and also the elevatd blood pressure .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nDischarge medications - Baclofen 10 p.o. t.i.d. , MVI one tablet p.o. q.d. , Mycostatin powder TP q.d. to be applied to the rash in her left groin area , also dilaudid 8 mg p.o. q2h , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. fentanyl patch 75 micrograms per hour topical q72 hours , atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.d.\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nFair .\\nShe remains very weak and will most likely benefit from some physical therapy andshe still has the bilateral edema .\\nShe is to go to the Necsoncardel Medical Center for more chronic care .\\nFollow-up is with Dr. Wedleung in the Hem / Onc in two weeks .\\nThe appointment has already been made .\\nThe patient is very limited in how much she can do right now because of her pain primarily and her difficulty breathing .\\nDictated By :\\nJEABRIHARL FIGEFREIERMFOTHGRENDCAJAQUE ,

complicated by pulmonary embolus this was followed by bone marrow transplant in 2000 he relapsed and underwent imiv3 cytoxan and finally ps341 which brought his disease to excellent control during may to october 2002 in november he began to experience rectal pain was diagnosed with a prolapsed hemorrhoid he had a bout of appendicitis followed by surgery for his hemorrhoid in december repeat surgery was required for another hemorrhoid the month of admission he had an anal fissure repaired and then began to have more significant problems with urinary retention requiring catheterization for control although he had noticed some problems with urinary retention up to two months ago on admission he complained of right lateral thigh buttock nerve pain he complained of fevers chills and night sweats and a 20 pound weight loss dyspnea on exertion lasting less than five minutes his last bowel movement was one week prior to admission he has no chest pain abdominal pain nausea vomiting or diarrhea

course by problem problem number 1 multiple myeloma the patient was restaged during his admission with a urine and serum electroimmunophoresis and a full skeletal survey he also received a fourday decadron burst the patient had pain in the l3 distribution his mri of the spine showed no clear reason for the pain and thus a pelvic ct was obtained showing a large right pelvic mass that likely was causing his leg pain radiation oncology was scheduled for next tuesday to irradiate the mass urinary retention although there was a t5 compression fracture compressing the cord without signal change there was no evidence that this lesion could be causing his urinary retention and it was felt that the pelvic mass more likely accounted for his urinary retention fevers his blood and urine cultures were obtained and remained negative throughout admission his chest xray did not reveal source of his fevers the patient was placed on levaquin shortness of breath the patient had a vq scan on admission that was low probability for pe the patient had no evidence of acute pulmonary embolus and his shortness of breath resolved over the course of his admission the patient had a t5 compression fracture with cord deformity neurosurgery was consulted no steroids were recommended a brace was ordered to stabilize the spine when the patient was up more than 10 minutes surgical intervention per dr jescneighagne was being evaluated and considered for the compression following his radiation therapy posterior fossa mass this mass was found on a screening mri of the head per neurosurgery

fever 4 history of ovarian cyst resection 1975 history of present illness the patient is a 49 year old woman with a metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast who is status post high dose chemotherapy with pbse and ccss support ending june 1994 she was admitted on 1594 for fever chest wall ulceration cellulitis and pain control the patient first presented in october 1991 with a tender right axillary mass a mammogram done in november 1990 was negative however mammography repeated in october 1991 showed bilateral breast masses suspicious for carcinoma fine needle aspiration on october 23 1991 demonstrated atypical cells which occurred singly and in clusters staging evaluation included normal liver function tests normal blood counts and normal chest xray bone scan showed degenerative joint disease in the shoulders and lumbar spine as well as increased radio chaser uptake in the breast bilaterally dr berca gachfrum performed a right modified mastectomy and left simple mastectomy on november 4 1991 the right modified radical mastectomy contained a 55 cm poorly differentiated grade iii out of iii infiltrating ductal carcinoma the margins were free of tumor but 10 out of 21 lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma furthermore there was a mass on the right pectoralis muscle which is supposed to be metastatic cancer the left simple mastectomy also contained 55 cm poorly differentiated infiltrating ductal and intraductal carcinoma with extensive lymphatic vessel invasion estrogen receptor was 0 by erica the patient developed a large hematoma requiring surgical drainage therefore she had a stage iiia adenocarcinoma of the breast since she was at high risk for both local and metastatic recurrence of her tumor she received both systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy the patient was treated with cmsap which is cytoxan methotrexate leukovoranrescue 5fu adriamycin and prednisone for four cycles there were no dose reductions for mucositis or myelosuppression however following cycle 4 she developed a flulike illness followed by fever nonproductive cough and dyspnea on exertion abgs showed a po2 of 79 ph 744 po2 33 chest xray showed diffuse interstitial infiltrates the differential diagnosis included viral pneumonitis mycoplasma chlamydia basically in december 1993 she returned to the hem onc clinic with chest wall nodules which turned out to be tumor recurrences and biopsied although she had mediastinal recurrence bone scan head and liver ct were negative for metastatic disease she was thus started on a protocol of high dose chemotherapy with gcsf and peripheral stem cell support complications has mainly included myelosuppression and mucositis she also developed klebsiella uti after the second cycle of high dose chemotherapy it was treated with gent and cipro restaging done in april 1993 showed a decrease in the pretracheal nodes with question of some lymphangitic spread versus some pneumonitis in may 1994 she received her first course of thiotepa and velban and methotrexate which required some red cell transfusions in mid may she was admitted for fever and neutropenia and at that time had a uti with blood clots in the urine the patient presents today with complaints of fever and a temperature of 100 she has also been having diarrhea since november and her other complaints of admission include confusion nausea and vomiting we will include a very thorough hpi with this dictation that was done by dr wedleung past medical history significant for metastatic breast cancer complicated by fever

positive for bilirubin and nitrogen and also 4 to 6 wbcs with 1 bacteria chest xray showed a left paratracheal adenopathy and small left pleural effusion with no evidence of pneumonia in summary the patient is a 49 year old woman with metastatic breast cell ca status post chemotherapy with cmsap and pvsc and xrt who presented with fever four days of diarrhea nausea and vomiting and had been on keflex for an erythema on her left chest wall the keflex was stopped when she developed the diarrhea when she arrived the plan was to go ahead and treat here rythematous induration and possible cellulitis with iv antibiotics so she was put on dicloxicillin and we did local wound care with an agent called santyl which is a collagenace ondebrided which worked very well for her also at the time of admission we were also considering palliative taxol chemotherapy which the patient declined she refused the taxol therapy so that was not done another major issue with this patient was pain control she had been in a whole lot of pain from her left arm lesion so pain control was a big issue so she was on ms contin and msir at home she thought that clouded her thinking so we tried different things for pain management one of them was to do a subarachnoid neurologic block at c6c7 interface on 1694 after that the patient had minimal relief of pain however she declined further blocks which were offered to her so accepted to be on dilaudid po which was started at a dosage of 24 meg but since then we have tapered it up she is now getting dilaudid 8 mg q2h and in addition she has been on fentanyl patch she is now getting 75 micrograms per hour of the fentanyl patch which is changed every 72 hours we can go up by 25 mg on the fentanyl patch as needed to control her pain and we can always go up on the dilaudid because she is still in considerable amount of pain other things that happened during this admission we obtained ahead ct for her on the 8th of january because of her clouded thinking and altered mental status which was probably due to the morphine that she was taking we went ahead and got a head ct scanand it showed no enhancing lesions in addition her liver transaminases were elevated we thought about doing further workup but that was deferred because the patient wanted to wait on that that has been stable the patient on january 13 became hyponatremic

HISTORY OF OVARIAN CYST RESECTION , 1975 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient is a 49 year old woman with a metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast who is status post high dose chemotherapy with PBSE and CCSS support ending June 1994 .\\nShe was admitted on 1-5-94 for fever , chest wall ulceration , cellulitis and pain control .\\nThe patient first presented in October 1991 with a tender right axillary mass .\\nA mammogram done in November 1990 was negative .\\nHowever , mammography repeated in October 1991 showed bilateral breast masses , suspicious for carcinoma .\\nFine needle aspiration on October 23 , 1991 demonstrated atypical cells which occurred singly and in clusters .\\nStaging evaluation included normal liver function tests , normal blood counts and normal chest x-ray .\\nBone scan showed degenerative joint disease in the shoulders and lumbar spine as well as increased radio chaser uptake in the breast bilaterally .\\nDr. Berca Gachfrum performed a right modified mastectomy and left simple mastectomy on November 4 , 1991 .\\nThe right modified radical mastectomy contained a 5.5 cm poorly differentiated , Grade III out of III infiltrating ductal carcinoma .\\nThe margins were free of tumor , but 10 out of 21 lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma .\\nFurthermore there was a mass on the right pectoralis muscle which is supposed to be metastatic cancer .\\nThe left simple mastectomy also contained 5.5 cm poorly differentiated infiltrating ductal and intraductal carcinoma with extensive lymphatic vessel invasion .\\nEstrogen receptor was 0% by ERICA .\\nThe patient developed a large hematoma requiring surgical drainage .\\nTherefore she had a Stage III-A adenocarcinoma of the breast .\\nSince she was at high risk for both local and metastatic recurrence of her tumor , she received both systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy .\\nThe patient was treated with CMSAP , which is Cytoxan , Methotrexate , Leukovoranrescue , 5-FU , Adriamycin and Prednisone for four cycles .\\nThere were no dose reductions for mucositis or myelosuppression .\\nHowever , following cycle 4 , she developed a flu-like illness , followed by fever , nonproductive cough and dyspnea on exertion .\\nABGs showed a pO2 of 79 , pH 7.44 , pO2 33 .\\nChest x-ray showed diffuse interstitial infiltrates .\\nThe differential diagnosis included viral pneumonitis , Mycoplasma , Chlamydia .\\nBasically in December 1993 , she returned to the Hem / Onc Clinic with chest wall nodules which turned out to be tumor recurrences and biopsied .\\nAlthough she had mediastinal recurrence , bone scan , head and liver CT were negative for metastatic disease .\\nShe was thus started on a Protocol of high dose chemotherapy with GCSF and peripheral stem cell support .\\nComplications has mainly included myelosuppression and mucositis .\\nShe also developed Klebsiella UTI after the second cycle of high dose chemotherapy .\\nIt was treated with gent and Cipro .\\nRe-staging done in April 1993 showed a decrease in the pretracheal nodes with question of some lymphangitic spread versus some pneumonitis .\\nIn May 1994 she received her first course of thiotepa and Velban and Methotrexate , which required some red cell transfusions .\\nIn mid May she was admitted for fever and neutropenia and at that time had a UTI with blood clots in the urine .\\nThe patient presents today with complaints of fever and a temperature of 100 .\\nShe has also been having diarrhea since November and her other complaints of admission include confusion , nausea and vomiting .\\nWe will include a very thorough HPI with this dictation that was done by Dr. Wedleung .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nSignificant for metastatic breast cancer , complicated by fever and neutropenia .\\nUTIs , obstruction of the right subclavian vein and right brachial cephalic vein , herpes zoster .\\nStatus post ovarian cyst resection in 1975 .\\nShe had menarche at age 15 .\\nShe used the pill for five years in the past .\\nShe is G 2 , P 2 with spontaneous vaginal deliveries .\\nShe has a history of easy bruis ability .\\nShe is allergic to Augmentin which gives her a rash .\\nMEDICATIONS :\\nMS Contin , MSIR , and Percocet .\\nFAMILY HISTORY :\\nNoncontributory .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nMarried with two children .\\nShe worked as an occupational therapist at a professional center for handicapped children .\\nShe denies tobacco and drug use and drinks ethanol socially .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nA cachectic white female .\\nT 100.1 , P 104 , blood pressure 130/90 , heart rate of 16 , she was sating 95% on room air .\\nHEENT - Pupils were miotic , measuring 2 mm but responsive to light .\\nNeck - Tender on the leftside with no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly .\\nLungs were clear .\\nChest actually had a 5 x 7 cm necrotic area on the left chest wall with some pus .\\nCardiovascular - Normal .\\nAbdomen - Normal .\\nThere was no HSM .\\nExtremities - Her left arm was very swollen .\\nIt was tested with no voluntary movement except at the finger tips .\\nThere was no edema elsewhere in her extremities , only the left arm .\\nNeuro - The patient was oriented to place , but had difficulty with recent memory .\\nShe also had mild weakness in the left extremities , both upper and lower .\\nCranial nerves II - XII were grossly intact .\\nToes were downgoing .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nOf note - Na 133 , K 4 , WBC 8.82 , hematocrit 35.1 , platelets 229 .\\nPT 13.8 with an INR of 1.3 , PTT 25.5 , total protein was 6.2 , albumin 3.4 , globulin of 2.8 , calcium of 9.1 , phos 2.7 , mag 2.1 , urea 3.7 .\\nALT was elevated at 240 , AST 85 , LDH 305 , alk phos 85 , total bilirubin was 1.3 , direct bili was .8 .\\nCholesterol 188 , triglyceride was 127 .\\nUA - trace protein , trace ketones , positive for bilirubin and nitrogen and also 4 to 6 wbcs with 1+ bacteria .\\nChest x-ray - Showed a left paratracheal adenopathy and small left pleural effusion with no evidence of pneumonia .\\nIn summary , the patient is a 49 year old woman with metastatic breast cell CA , status post chemotherapy with CMSAP and PVSC and XRT who presented with fever , four days of diarrhea , nausea and vomiting and had been on Keflex for an erythema on her left chest wall .\\nThe Keflex was stopped when she developed the diarrhea .\\nWhen she arrived the plan was to go ahead and treat here rythematous induration and possible cellulitis with IV antibiotics .\\nSo she was put on dicloxicillin and we did local wound care with an agent called Santyl , which is a collagenace ondebrided which worked very well for her .\\nAlso at the time of admission we were also considering palliative Taxol chemotherapy , which the patient declined .\\nShe refused the Taxol therapy so that was not done .\\nAnother major issue with this patient was pain control .\\nShe had been in a whole lot of pain from her left arm lesion .\\nSo pain control was a big issue so she was on MS Contin and MSIR at home she thought that clouded her thinking , so we tried different things for pain management .\\nOne of them was to do a subarachnoid neurologic block at C6-C7 interface on 1-6-94 .\\nAfter that the patient had minimal relief of pain .\\nHowever , she declined further blocks , which were offered to her .\\nSo accepted to be on dilaudid p.o. which was started at a dosage of 2-4 meg but since then we have tapered it up .\\nShe is now getting dilaudid 8 mg q2h and in addition she has been on fentanyl patch .\\nShe is now getting 75 micrograms per hour of the fentanyl patch which is changed every 72 hours .\\nWe can go up by 25 mg on the fentanyl patch as needed to control her pain and we can always go up on the dilaudid because she is still in considerable amount of pain .\\nOther things that happened during this admission - we obtained ahead CT for her on the 8th of January because of her clouded thinking and altered mental status , which was probably due to the morphine that she was taking .\\nWe went ahead and got a head CT scanand it showed no enhancing lesions .\\nIn addition her liver transaminases were elevated , we thought about doing further work-up , but that was deferred because the patient wanted to wait on that .\\nThat has been stable .\\nThe patient on January 13 became hyponatremic .\\nHer sodium went down to 121 and before that on admission she was 133 .\\nA renal consult was obtained and their assessment was that this was probably a mixture of hypovolemia as well as SIADH .\\nWe proceeded to do for her hyponatremia - we gave her some fluid and her urine sodium became higher than her serum sodium ; we stopped it .\\nWe had given her some normal saline and then we proceeded to just do fluid restriction .\\nIn addition we gave her a sodium chloride one gram per day and that also helped , so that now at the time of discharge , the patient 's sodium is between 126 and 129 ; prior to that it had gone down to as low 116.\\nSo that has really improved .\\nWe suggest continuing increased salt intake in her diet and also continuing with the fluid restriction of free water intake to one liter per day .\\nOn the 14th of January , the patient developed increased shortness of breath and chest x-ray was taken showed a wedge shaped infiltrate in the right upper lobe which was consistent with Hampton 's hump .\\nAlso a VQ scan obtained the next day showed high probability for PE .\\nSo we proceeded to put her on heparin for anticoagulation and then when she was therapeutic on heparin , we went ahead and started her on coumadin and she is currently on coumadin at 2.5 mg q.h.s.\\nHer INR is 2.3 .\\nWe want her INR to remain between 2 and 3 .\\nSo if it goes much lower than 2 , then we would consider increasing it to perhaps coumadin 2.5 and 5 alternating every other night .\\nHowever , we would leave it at 2.5 for now .\\nOther major issues - As a result of all the things happened and with her hyponatremia and also the other problems , her blood pressure was elevated also .\\nWe put her on nifedipine IR , SL and that was not enough to control her blood pressure which was in the 200s in the systolic , so we had started her on atenolol .\\nSo on discharge she is on atenolol 100 .\\nIf needed to you can give her some nifedipine SL to decrease her blood pressure .\\nThe patient also has significant edema in both arms now and also some mild edema in the lower extremities , so I think that fluid restriction should help with that .\\nShe is also a little dry .\\nThe patient is on oxygen .\\nEver since the pulmonary embolus she has been on oxygen .\\nShe was on 4 liters ; now she is on 5 liters , sating 94 to 96% on 5 liters .\\nWe would like for her to remain on the oxygen as well .\\nThe complications that I have listed include the hyponatremia , pulmonary embolus and also the elevatd blood pressure .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nDischarge medications - Baclofen 10 p.o. t.i.d. ,

History of pulmonary embolism .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nMr. Chysfreierm is a 53-year-old man with Kappa lyte chain multiple myeloma admitted with pain , shortness of breath , fevers and weight loss .\\nHe was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 1999 .\\nHe underwent radiation and VAD complicated by pulmonary embolus .\\nThis was followed by bone marrow transplant in 2000 .\\nHe relapsed and underwent IMIV-3 , Cytoxan and finally PS-341 , which brought his disease to excellent control during May to October , 2002 .\\nIn November he began to experience rectal pain , was diagnosed with a prolapsed hemorrhoid .\\nHe had a bout of appendicitis followed by surgery for his hemorrhoid in December .\\nRepeat surgery was required for another hemorrhoid .\\nThe month of admission he had an anal fissure repaired and then began to have more significant problems with urinary retention requiring catheterization for control , although he had noticed some problems with urinary retention up to two months ago .\\nOn admission he complained of right lateral thigh , buttock , \\\" nerve \\\" pain .\\nHe complained of fevers , chills and night sweats and a 20 pound weight loss , dyspnea on exertion lasting less than five minutes .\\nHis last bowel movement was one week prior to admission .\\nHe has no chest pain , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting or diarrhea .\\nALLERGIES :\\nHe has no known drug allergies .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nHe is a former software engineer .\\nHe is married and has two children .\\nFAMILY HISTORY :\\nNoncontributory .\\nHis problem list is as per the problem list .\\nPERTINENT PHYSICAL FINDINGS ON ADMISSION :\\nVITAL SIGNS :\\nBlood pressure 153/92 , pulse 102 , respirations 20 , temperature 99 degrees Fahrenheit , satting 93 to 94% on room air .\\nGENERAL :\\nThe patient was awake and alert , in no acute distress .\\nHEENT :\\nPupils were equal , round , reactive to light .\\nHis extraocular movements were intact .\\nHis oropharynx was somewhat dry , but otherwise clear .\\nNECK :\\nHe had no lymphadenopathy .\\nHEART :\\nHis heart was regular rate and rhythm without gallops , however , II-III / VI systolic ejection murmur was heard .\\nLUNGS :\\nHis lungs were bilaterally clear to auscultation .\\nABDOMEN :\\nHis abdomen was benign .\\nEXTREMITIES :\\nThere was no edema of his extremities .\\nHis strength was 5/5 throughout .\\nSensation was intact grossly .\\nHe had 2+ symmetric reflexes with down-going toes bilaterally .\\nNEUROLOGIC :\\nHis cranial nerves were intact .\\nLABORATORY RESULTS ON ADMISSION :\\nSodium 133 , potassium 3.7 , creatinine 0.6 with a BUN of 5 , glucose 151 .\\nAlkaline phosphatase was 392 .\\nWhite count was 7 .\\nHematocrit was 24.6 .\\nHis INR was 1.3 with a PTT of 101 .\\nCalcium was 8.4 , phosphate 2.8 , mag 1.8 .\\nUA showed 30 to 40 red blood cells but had a negative dip stick .\\nHis chest X-ray showed elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with the colon of normal diameter , his new left rib fracture and soft tissue densities at the second rib and lateral sixth rib and then upper thoracic compression fracture .\\nThere were no complications of his admission .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM :\\nProblem number 1 , multiple myeloma .\\nThe patient was re-staged during his admission with a urine and serum electroimmunophoresis and a full skeletal survey .\\nHe also received a four-day Decadron burst .\\nThe patient had pain in the L3 distribution .\\nHis MRI of the spine showed no clear reason for the pain and thus , a pelvic CT was obtained showing a large right pelvic mass that likely was causing his leg pain .\\nRadiation oncology was scheduled for next Tuesday to irradiate the mass .\\nUrinary retention .\\nAlthough there was a T5 compression fracture compressing the cord without signal change , there was no evidence that this lesion could be causing his urinary retention ; and it was felt that the pelvic mass more likely accounted for his urinary retention .\\nFevers .\\nHis blood and urine cultures were obtained and remained negative throughout admission .\\nHis chest X-ray did not reveal source of his fevers .\\nThe patient was placed on Levaquin .\\nShortness of breath .\\nThe patient had a V-Q scan on admission that was low probability for PE .\\nThe patient had no evidence of acute pulmonary embolus and his shortness of breath resolved over the course of his admission .\\nThe patient had a T5 compression fracture with cord deformity .\\nNeurosurgery was consulted .\\nNo steroids were recommended .\\nA brace was ordered to stabilize the spine when the patient was up more than 10 minutes .\\nSurgical intervention per Dr. Jescneighagne was being evaluated and considered for the compression following his radiation therapy .\\nPosterior fossa mass .\\nThis mass was found on a screening MRI of the head per neurosurgery .\\nRadiation oncology also plans radiation to that lesion while he is getting radiation for the pelvic mass .\\nThe patient had no evidence of cerebellar dysfunction on discharge .\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\n1. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.\\n2. Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.\\n3. Senna tablets two tabs p.o. b.i.d.\\n4. MS Contin 30 mg p.o. b.i.d.\\n5. Neurontin 300 mg p.o. t.i.d.\\n6.

HISTORY OF OVARIAN CYST RESECTION , 1975 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient is a 49 year old woman with a metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast who is status post high dose chemotherapy with PBSE and CCSS support ending June 1994 .\\nShe was admitted on 1-5-94 for fever , chest wall ulceration , cellulitis and pain control .\\nThe patient first presented in October 1991 with a tender right axillary mass .\\nA mammogram done in November 1990 was negative .\\nHowever , mammography repeated in October 1991 showed bilateral breast masses , suspicious for carcinoma .\\nFine needle aspiration on October 23 , 1991 demonstrated atypical cells which occurred singly and in clusters .\\nStaging evaluation included normal liver function tests , normal blood counts and normal chest x-ray .\\nBone scan showed degenerative joint disease in the shoulders and lumbar spine as well as increased radio chaser uptake in the breast bilaterally .\\nDr. Berca Gachfrum performed a right modified mastectomy and left simple mastectomy on November 4 , 1991 .\\nThe right modified radical mastectomy contained a 5.5 cm poorly differentiated , Grade III out of III infiltrating ductal carcinoma .\\nThe margins were free of tumor , but 10 out of 21 lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma .\\nFurthermore there was a mass on the right pectoralis muscle which is supposed to be metastatic cancer .\\nThe left simple mastectomy also contained 5.5 cm poorly differentiated infiltrating ductal and intraductal carcinoma with extensive lymphatic vessel invasion .\\nEstrogen receptor was 0% by ERICA .\\nThe patient developed a large hematoma requiring surgical drainage .\\nTherefore she had a Stage III-A adenocarcinoma of the breast .\\nSince she was at high risk for both local and metastatic recurrence of her tumor , she received both systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy .\\nThe patient was treated with CMSAP , which is Cytoxan , Methotrexate , Leukovoranrescue , 5-FU , Adriamycin and Prednisone for four cycles .\\nThere were no dose reductions for mucositis or myelosuppression .\\nHowever , following cycle 4 , she developed a flu-like illness , followed by fever , nonproductive cough and dyspnea on exertion .\\nABGs showed a pO2 of 79 , pH 7.44 , pO2 33 .\\nChest x-ray showed diffuse interstitial infiltrates .\\nThe differential diagnosis included viral pneumonitis , Mycoplasma , Chlamydia .\\nBasically in December 1993 , she returned to the Hem / Onc Clinic with chest wall nodules which turned out to be tumor recurrences and biopsied .\\nAlthough she had mediastinal recurrence , bone scan , head and liver CT were negative for metastatic disease .\\nShe was thus started on a Protocol of high dose chemotherapy with GCSF and peripheral stem cell support .\\nComplications has mainly included myelosuppression and mucositis .\\nShe also developed Klebsiella UTI after the second cycle of high dose chemotherapy .\\nIt was treated with gent and Cipro .\\nRe-staging done in April 1993 showed a decrease in the pretracheal nodes with question of some lymphangitic spread versus some pneumonitis .\\nIn May 1994 she received her first course of thiotepa and Velban and Methotrexate , which required some red cell transfusions .\\nIn mid May she was admitted for fever and neutropenia and at that time had a UTI with blood clots in the urine .\\nThe patient presents today with complaints of fever and a temperature of 100 .\\nShe has also been having diarrhea since November and her other complaints of admission include confusion , nausea and vomiting .\\nWe will include a very thorough HPI with this dictation that was done by Dr. Wedleung .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nSignificant for metastatic breast cancer , complicated by fever and neutropenia .\\nUTIs , obstruction of the right subclavian vein and right brachial cephalic vein , herpes zoster .\\nStatus post ovarian cyst resection in 1975 .\\nShe had menarche at age 15 .\\nShe used the pill for five years in the past .\\nShe is G 2 , P 2 with spontaneous vaginal deliveries .\\nShe has a history of easy bruis ability .\\nShe is allergic to Augmentin which gives her a rash .\\nMEDICATIONS :\\nMS Contin , MSIR , and Percocet .\\nFAMILY HISTORY :\\nNoncontributory .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nMarried with two children .\\nShe worked as an occupational therapist at a professional center for handicapped children .\\nShe denies tobacco and drug use and drinks ethanol socially .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nA cachectic white female .\\nT 100.1 , P 104 , blood pressure 130/90 , heart rate of 16 , she was sating 95% on room air .\\nHEENT - Pupils were miotic , measuring 2 mm but responsive to light .\\nNeck - Tender on the leftside with no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly .\\nLungs were clear .\\nChest actually had a 5 x 7 cm necrotic area on the left chest wall with some pus .\\nCardiovascular - Normal .\\nAbdomen - Normal .\\nThere was no HSM .\\nExtremities - Her left arm was very swollen .\\nIt was tested with no voluntary movement except at the finger tips .\\nThere was no edema elsewhere in her extremities , only the left arm .\\nNeuro - The patient was oriented to place , but had difficulty with recent memory .\\nShe also had mild weakness in the left extremities , both upper and lower .\\nCranial nerves II - XII were grossly intact .\\nToes were downgoing .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nOf note - Na 133 , K 4 , WBC 8.82 , hematocrit 35.1 , platelets 229 .\\nPT 13.8 with an INR of 1.3 , PTT 25.5 , total protein was 6.2 , albumin 3.4 , globulin of 2.8 , calcium of 9.1 , phos 2.7 , mag 2.1 , urea 3.7 .\\nALT was elevated at 240 , AST 85 , LDH 305 , alk phos 85 , total bilirubin was 1.3 , direct bili was .8 .\\nCholesterol 188 , triglyceride was 127 .\\nUA - trace protein , trace ketones , positive for bilirubin and nitrogen and also 4 to 6 wbcs with 1+ bacteria .\\nChest x-ray - Showed a left paratracheal adenopathy and small left pleural effusion with no evidence of pneumonia .\\nIn summary , the patient is a 49 year old woman with metastatic breast cell CA , status post chemotherapy with CMSAP and PVSC and XRT who presented with fever , four days of diarrhea , nausea and vomiting and had been on Keflex for an erythema on her left chest wall .\\nThe Keflex was stopped when she developed the diarrhea .\\nWhen she arrived the plan was to go ahead and treat here rythematous induration and possible cellulitis with IV antibiotics .\\nSo she was put on dicloxicillin and we did local wound care with an agent called Santyl , which is a collagenace ondebrided which worked very well for her .\\nAlso at the time of admission we were also considering palliative Taxol chemotherapy , which the patient declined .\\nShe refused the Taxol therapy so that was not done .\\nAnother major issue with this patient was pain control .\\nShe had been in a whole lot of pain from her left arm lesion .\\nSo pain control was a big issue so she was on MS Contin and MSIR at home she thought that clouded her thinking , so we tried different things for pain management .\\nOne of them was to do a subarachnoid neurologic block at C6-C7 interface on 1-6-94 .\\nAfter that the patient had minimal relief of pain .\\nHowever , she declined further blocks , which were offered to her .\\nSo accepted to be on dilaudid p.o. which was started at a dosage of 2-4 meg but since then we have tapered it up .\\nShe is now getting dilaudid 8 mg q2h and in addition she has been on fentanyl patch .\\nShe is now getting 75 micrograms per hour of the fentanyl patch which is changed every 72 hours .\\nWe can go up by 25 mg on the fentanyl patch as needed to control her pain and we can always go up on the dilaudid because she is still in considerable amount of pain .\\nOther things that happened during this admission - we obtained ahead CT for her on the 8th of January because of her clouded thinking and altered mental status , which was probably due to the morphine that she was taking .\\nWe went ahead and got a head CT scanand it showed no enhancing lesions .\\nIn addition her liver transaminases were elevated , we thought about doing further work-up , but that was deferred because the patient wanted to wait on that .\\nThat has been stable .\\nThe patient on January 13 became hyponatremic .\\nHer sodium went down to 121 and before that on admission she was 133 .\\nA renal consult was obtained and their assessment was that this was probably a mixture of hypovolemia as well as SIADH .\\nWe proceeded to do for her hyponatremia - we gave her some fluid and her urine sodium became higher than her serum sodium ; we stopped it .\\nWe had given her some normal saline and then we proceeded to just do fluid restriction .\\nIn addition we gave her a sodium chloride one gram per day and that also helped , so that now at the time of discharge , the patient 's sodium is between 126 and 129 ; prior to that it had gone down to as low 116.\\nSo that has really improved .\\nWe suggest continuing increased salt intake in her diet and also continuing with the fluid restriction of free water intake to one liter per day .\\nOn the 14th of January , the patient developed increased shortness of breath and chest x-ray was taken showed a wedge shaped infiltrate in the right upper lobe which was consistent with Hampton 's hump .\\nAlso a VQ scan obtained the next day showed high probability for PE .\\nSo we proceeded to put her on heparin for anticoagulation and then when she was therapeutic on heparin , we went ahead and started her on coumadin and she is currently on coumadin at 2.5 mg q.h.s.\\nHer INR is 2.3 .\\nWe want her INR to remain between 2 and 3 .\\nSo if it goes much lower than 2 , then we would consider increasing it to perhaps coumadin 2.5 and 5 alternating every other night .\\nHowever , we would leave it at 2.5 for now .\\nOther major issues - As a result of all the things happened and with her hyponatremia and also the other problems , her blood pressure was elevated also .\\nWe put her on nifedipine IR , SL and that was not enough to control her blood pressure which was in the 200s in the systolic , so we had started her on atenolol .\\nSo on discharge she is on atenolol 100 .\\nIf needed to you can give her some nifedipine SL to decrease her blood pressure .\\nThe patient also has significant edema in both arms now and also some mild edema in the lower extremities , so I think that fluid restriction should help with that .\\nShe is also a little dry .\\nThe patient is on oxygen .\\nEver since the pulmonary embolus she has been on oxygen .\\nShe was on 4 liters ; now she is on 5 liters , sating 94 to 96% on 5 liters .\\nWe would like for her to remain on the oxygen as well .\\nThe complications that I have listed include the hyponatremia , pulmonary embolus and also the elevatd blood pressure .\\nDISPOSITION :\\nDischarge medications - Baclofen 10 p.o. t.i.d. , MVI one tablet p.o. q.d. , Mycostatin powder TP q.d. to be applied to the rash in her left groin area , also dilaudid 8 mg p.o. q2h , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. fentanyl patch 75 micrograms per hour topical q72 hours , atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.d.\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nFair .\\nShe remains very weak and will most likely benefit from some physical therapy andshe still has the bilateral edema .\\nShe is to go to the Necsoncardel Medical Center for more chronic care .\\nFollow-up is with Dr. Wedleung in the Hem / Onc in two weeks .\\nThe appointment has already been made .\\nThe patient is very limited in how much she can do right now because of her pain primarily and her difficulty breathing .\\nDictated By :\\nJEABRIHARL FIGEFREIERMFOTHGRENDCAJAQUE ,
